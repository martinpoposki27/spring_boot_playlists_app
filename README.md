# Playlists App

The music playlist web app that I developed is an innovative application that changes the music playlists based on the weather outside. This app was built using the Spring Boot framework, which is a popular Java web framework that simplifies the process of building enterprise-grade applications. In addition, I used Thymeleaf, which is a server-side Java template engine that simplifies the process of creating dynamic web pages.

To store the data, I used PostgreSQL, which is a powerful and reliable open-source database system. This allowed me to store large amounts of data, and to retrieve the data quickly and easily when required.

One of the key features of this application is the ability to call external APIs using the RestTemplate from Spring Framework. This is a part of Spring designed for client HTTP access. To get the JSON object from openweather.com, I used the URI Template, which is also part of the Spring framework. I then converted the JSON object into an object using the object mapper from Jackson.

The app works by getting the current weather conditions from openweather.com, and then using those conditions to generate a music playlist that is appropriate for the current weather. For example, on a sunny day, the app might generate a playlist of upbeat and energetic music, while on a rainy day, the app might generate a playlist of mellow and relaxing music.

Overall, the music playlist web app that I developed is an exciting and innovative application that uses cutting-edge technologies to provide a unique and personalized user experience. Through this project, I have gained experience in building web applications using Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, PostgreSQL, and other modern technologies, as well as working with external APIs and data conversion using Jackson.
